#  Operators in Python
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
a=10+5
b=10-5
c=10*5
d=10/5
e=10%3
# 2. Comparison Operators
print("Is a equal to b?", a == b)
# The value of the comparison will be boolean, either True or False.
x=10>=5
print(x)

# 3. Assignment Operators
m=10
m-=5  # This is equivalent to m = m - 5


# 4. Logical Operators
n= 10>5 and 11<12  
print("Is n true?", n)

#  This are not the commonly used operators in Python, but they are available:
# 5. Bitwise Operators
# 6. Membership Operators
